# Week Week 7 - JavaScript Assignment

## Assignment Questions

- How many hours do you estimate you spent completing the assignment? 20-25
- What was easiest? Getting the basic layout set up
- What was most difficult? Can't quite figure out how to populate JSON data. I saw some tutorials and was able to get it to work with the tutorial (which utilized Express and Axios), but it doesn't work with my current project structure. I ended up creating a data.pug file which has a JavaScript for populating data for the products page. The products page is different from last week as I had to simplify it. It would be nice to figure out how to make it work with my product page from last week.
